# Intuition and Primer for General Relativity and Differential Geometry

My aim with this document is to bridge the gap that I often see (and experienced myself) when physicists
are taught cosmology. In a perfect world, courses building to and on differential geometry would be taken
before courses on General Relativity and Cosmology. For physics undergraduates, this is often not possible
and in all honesty is not required. However, this makes learning the material more challenging and courses
are often not designed with this in mind. In this document I will start from early undergraduate physics and
mathematics taken in standard physics degrees. In other words I will only require the following knowledge:
multivariable calculus, linear algebra, ordinary differential equations, and some classical mechanics (if you
know what a Lagrangian is, youâ€™re set). From that, I will motivate many critical elements for the machinery
and results normally taught in courses on General Relativity and Cosmology.

In this github repository, I'm going to also have the .tex files and old versions for the sake of my personal interest.
